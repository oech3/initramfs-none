# initramfs-none
Minimal and hardcoted initramfs to mount `/` with `noatime` directly.
This is personal workaround for https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61601 .

# Motivation
We can boot Linux without initramfs if kernel modules of our strage device and filesystem of `/` is built-in as built-in.
For example, AHCI and Btrfs modules are built-in ar Arch Linux (see https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_boot_process#Running_without_initramfs).

However, booting with `rootflags=noatime` without initramfs is impossible (see https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61601).
Surprisingly, moduleless initramfs generated by https://github.com/anatol/booster is faster than no initramfs+remounting `/` with `noatime` in my machine.
Then I made `init` binary for initramfs to mount `/` with `noatime` flag.

# (No) Advantage
It seems this is 0.2~0.3 s faster than moduleless booster. No reason to use this. Use https://github.com/anatol/booster .
